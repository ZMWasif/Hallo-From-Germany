            Authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas
            authorization is the process of verifying what specific
            applications, files, and data a user has access to. Authentication
            and authorization accomplish these same goals. Authentication is
            used to verify that users really are who they represent themselves
            to be. Once this has been confirmed, authorization is then used to
            grant the user permission to access different levels of information
            and perform specific functions, depending on the rules established
            for different types of users.

            Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to

            Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs,
            and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to our app. It
            supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular
            federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and
            more. Other ways to authenticate can be through cards, retina scans,
            voice recognition, and fingerprints.
